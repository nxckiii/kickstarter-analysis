# Kickstarter Analysis

**Overview of Project**
The purpose of this analysis is to get a hands-on experience on Excel and utilize its data analytic tools that represent hypothetical future projects many analysts can work on. Kickstarter Analysis Excelsheet was highly versatile where you could see different points of view and draw various conclusions from the final results and data. It is excellent to navigate and use filters, graphs, and tables to organize and visualize data to reveal trends, issues, etc. Especially, to help out Louise and her passion for theater. 

**Analysis and Challenges**

*Analysis*

The outcomes, goals, and potentials pledges are all in this dataset for Louise to analyze, set up incentives, and determine her goals and how to achieve them. Using conditionals, pivot tables, and formulas, were great ways to help the visualization.

*Overcoming Challenges*

While there were a few hiccups in creating and executing the final analysis, the step-by-step process was vital. First, knowing the master list aka Kickstarter is crucial and going over the Module and practicing eases up the intensity of information it holds. It was also handy to note the formula used and know which cell belongs to part of the equation. One of the most significant issues that I had to deal with in this analysis is my Excel sheet didn't permanently save the updated version. After the third time it happened, I started to note where I was and which formula I was using. The second issue I came across is using =COUNTIFS properly. After a brief lesson from Youtube and classroom help, I input the correct, final equation. Lastly, the submission of my analysis into Github. It is a bit nerve wrecking to know submission went through or not.  

**Results**
 
 *Conclusion*
 
  a) One conclusion drawn about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that theater is popular during the Spring/Summer months, especially from May to June. You can predict as to why around this time is popular to go to the theater (nice weather, great field trips, date nights, more happy people, etc). Another conclusion that can be drawn about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that the graph shows a negative skew after August. It is typically when season changes and people are more focused on work/school rather and have less leisure time to go out to the theaters. 
  b) A conclusion about the Outcomes-based on Goal is that when the theater's goal is less than 1000 in currency, there was far more success rate (76%) than the rest of the data.
 
 **Limitations**
 
 c) Some limitations of this dataset could be that there may be missing data or inconsistencies/errors in data sets that have not been picked up. 

**Future Analysis**

  d) Possible tables or graphs we could create is what type of media is trending. Knowing that we can also use this dataset to know how much a project was invested in (goals, pledges, etc) and predict the success of it. Of course, additional brainstorming on originality and boldness needs to be factored in and a large demographic can increase high ratings. I suggest using a histogram in this data to analyze the "success", "canceled", and "failed" whether they met the audience requirements.
